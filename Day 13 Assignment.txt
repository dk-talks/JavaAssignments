				Day 13 Assignment 

1. What is the default values of arrays for different data types?
Ans	   a.  Int --> 0	
		b. String --> null
		c. Boolean --> false
		d. User-defined --> null
		e. Double --> 0.0

2. Can you pass negative numbers is array size?
Ans - No, we cannot otherwise it will throw 'NegativeArraySizeException:'

3. Where does array are stored in jvm memory?
Ans - Since Arrays are reference types. So they are stored into the heap memory.


4. What are the disadvantages of an array?
Ans a. Arrays are Homogenous (only similar types of data can be stored into an array).
	b. Their size is fixed after declaration. It cannot be changed.

5. What is an anonymous array in Java? Give example.
Ans - An array which does not have a name is called an anonymous array.
	Ex - I can give an anonymous array as an argument in a method which accepts array as parameter.
	
	void add(int[] numbers) {
	
	
	};

	So, I can provide anonymous array here like - add(new int[]{4,54,6,7,8,69});

6. What are the different ways to traverse an array in Java?
Ans - We can use either for loop or Enhanced for-each loop (also called Enhanced for loop) to traverse into an array.
		Enhanced for loop is more preferred because that's what it was made for.

7. What is the difference between length and length() method? Give example.

Ans - length is a property of array which gives the length of an array.
	Example int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5};
		so here nums.length will return 5.
	
	Whereas length() is a method of String which returns number of characters in a string.
	Example String name = "Dinesh";
		so here name.length() will return 6.
