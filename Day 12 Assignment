       				Day 12 Assignment:-

1. What do you mean by an array?
Ans -  An array is a collection of similar types of data which can be accessed using its index number.
		In java, array can store both primitive and non primitive types of data.

2. How to create an array?
Ans - In java array is an object type, to create an array these are the syntaxes -
		int[] arr1 = {2,3,4,5}; // if we have the data at the time of creation.
					OR
		int[] arr2 =  new int[5]; // here 5 is the number of elements inside this array.
		To create 2D array use —> int[][] arr3 = new int[4][4];

3. Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
Ans - No.

4. Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
Ans - Yes we can, but before using it we have to initialise it. Otherwise it will give compile time error (array is not initialised).

5. What is the default value of an array?
Ans - Default value of array types - 
		int array —> 0
		string array —> null
		boolean array —> false
		double array —> 0.0	
		user-defined array —> null

6. What is a 1D array with an example?
Ans - A 1-dimensional array is a kind of array which do not have any nested array inside an array or it has only one row and multiple columns.
	example - int[] arr1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}; // here you will not see any nested arrays inside arr1.

7. Write a program on a 2D array.
Ans - A program on a 2D array which initialise a 2D array and print its data on to the console.
	
		int[][] marks = { {10,11,12},
						   {12,65},
						   {56,100, 99.9} 
							};

		// we will use enhanced for loop here
	
		for(int parent[]: marks) {
			for(int child: parent) {
				System.out.print(chid + “ “);
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
