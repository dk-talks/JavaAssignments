Day 8 Assignment 

1. What are the conditional operators in Java?
Ans - When a condition consists of multiple boolean expressions, they are used. Use
	  conditional operators to combine two expressions, such as when we wish to print
	  a number only if it is larger than 2 and less than 5, respectively.

		We have 3 types of conditional operators -
		● Logical-and Operator(&&)
		● Logical-or Operator(||)
		● Ternary operator(?:)

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans - Two types of operators - Unary and Binary.
	Unary - Performs operation on single operand. Ex (++, --)
	Binary - Performs operation on two operands. Ex (==, <, > etc)

3. What is the use of Switch case in Java Programming?
Ans - Switch case is needed when we actually know the comparison value before only. 
	It makes it simpler when we have multiple cases rather than using if-else statements.
	ex - We can use it on Day Names, Name of months etc.

4. What is the priority level of arithmetic operators in Java?
Ans - Priority level is Parenthesis > Exponents > Division/Multiplication > Addition/Subtraction > Modulus.

5. What are conditional statements and their use in Java?
Ans - Conditional statements are some block of code to decide based on some given condition.	
	Their use is to make decision in programming.

6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans syntax is --> if(some condition) {
				//code if condition is true
			   } else {
				//code if condition is false
			   }
7. What are the three types of iterative statements in Java?
Ans - Three type of iterative statements in Java are - 
	1. For loop
		syntax - for(initialisation; condition; update) {
				//block of code
			    }
	2. While loop
		syntax - while(condition) {
				//block of code
				update here (otherwise loop will become infinite)
			    }
				
	3. Do-while loop
		syntax - do {
				//block of code
				update here (otherwise loop will become infinite)
			    } while (condition);

8. Write down the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans - For loop - 
		Condition is checked before the execution of the code (entry-controlled loop).
		It might be possible it never runs the block of code due to condition.
	 While loop -
		Fist the execution happens and then the condition is checked (exit-controlled loop)
		This loop will run at-least once even if condition is false. 

9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans - 
	for(int num = 1; num<11; num++) {
		System.out.println(num);
	}
