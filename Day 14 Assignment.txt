1. What is a String in Java?

Ans - In Java, String is an inbuilt class which contains collection of characters
	   enclosed in double quotes (" "). By nature strings are immutable.

2. Types of strings in java are.

Ans - There are two types of String in Java.
	a. Immutable String - which cannot be changed. If tried to change, it will create
		a new object and original string will remain intact. 
		These types of strings are created using String class.

	b. Mutable String - Can be changed in future after initialization. These types of strings
		are created using StringBuilder OR StringBuffer classes.

3. In how many ways you can create string object in Java?

Ans - Broadly speaking, There are two ways to create string object in java.
	  1. Without using new keyword
		ex - String name = "Dinesh Sharma";
		here the object will be created into String Constant pool which stays inside heap memory.
		and duplicates are not allowed here.

	  2. With using new keyword
		ex - String name = new String("Dinesh Sharma");
		here the object will be created outside the SCP inside the heap memory and duplicates are allowed.
		
	  We can also create String using array of characters.
		example - char ch[] = {'d', 'I', 'n', 'e', 's', 'h'};
				   String name = new String(ch);

4. What is a String Constant Pool?
Ans - it is a special area inside the heap memory where all the Strings declared in the program are stored.
	  Duplicate strings are not allowed in this area.

5. What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects?
Ans - Mutable objects means if once they are created, their values cannot be changed in the future 
	  on the other hand in case of Immutable objects their values can be changed even after creation.

6. Where exactly is the String Constant Pool located in the memory?
Ans - Heap memory.
