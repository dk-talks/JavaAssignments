Day 7 Assignment - 

1. What is Statically typed and Dynamically type programming language?
Ans - Statically - Language which are require to mention type of datatype of any variable they are statically typed, if we don’t provide datatype that will through a compile time error.
		Dynamically - Languages which do not require to mention the datatype and that intelligently assign the datatype at the time of runtime.

2. What is the variable in Java?
Ans - A variable in java is a location in the memory which stores the value in it. 
		example int varName = “Value of the Variable”;  - it will create a memory location named varName and its value will be “Value of the Variable”

3. How to assign a value to a variable?
Ans - We assign a value to a variable using Assignment Operator.
		Ex - int num1 = 1; here “=“ is an assignment operator.

4. What are primitive data types in Java?
Ans - Primitive datatypes are those basic datatypes from which all other datatypes are constructed. In Java there are 8 primitive data types.
		Integer - 1. Byte, 2. Short, 3. Int, 4. Long 
		Real numbers - 1. Float, 2. Double
		logical - 1. Boolean (true OR false)
		character - 1. Char (Java follows UTF-16 formatting so it consists of 2 bytes.)

5. What are the Identifiers in java?
Ans -Identifiers is a name give to any class, variable, package or method.
 
6. List the operators in Java?
Ans -   1. Arithmetic Operators - +, -, /, *, %
		2. Relational Operators ==, <, >, <=, >=, !
		3. Logical Operators &&, ||, !
		4. Assignment Operators =
		5. Unary Operators
		6. Bitwise Operators

7. Explain about Increment and decrement operators and give an example.
	Increment operator is used to add one (1) to any variable it is assigned (ex- a++) to and decrement is used to subtract. (ex- a—).
	They are of two types- Post and Pre.
	Post Incr/Decr - In Post Increment (a++) the value of a will be assigned first and then its value will be incremented 
	Whereas in Pre Increment (++a) the value will be incremented first and then assigned.

	example —
	
	int a = 5;
	int b = a++;
	here value of a is 6 and value of b is 5 only because the value of a was assigned already even before incrementing.
